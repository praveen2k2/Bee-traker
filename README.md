![Beehive Monitoring System](path_to_image.jpg)

## Introduction

The Beehive Monitoring System is designed to help beekeepers monitor the health and activity of their beehives without disturbing the bees. This device measures humidity, temperature, and population inside the beehive and displays the necessary information on a user-friendly interface. It is designed to be easily installed at the entrance of the beehive and is both user-friendly and repair-friendly.

## Features

- **Temperature Monitoring**: Tracks the internal temperature of the beehive.
- **Humidity Monitoring**: Monitors the internal humidity levels.
- **Population Tracking**: Estimates the population of the beehive.
- **User-Friendly Display**: Provides an easy-to-read display of all measurements.
- **Repair-Friendly Design**: Ensures easy maintenance and repair.
